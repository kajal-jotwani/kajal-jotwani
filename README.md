## 🌱 A little about me

✨ **Third-year Computer Science undergrad** 

💻 **Backend, Systems & Beyond**  
I enjoy exploring backend technologies, system design, and how things work under the hood.  
Currently diving into **AI**, **MCP**, and understanding how modern intelligent systems are built (it genuinely fascinates me).

🌍 **Open Source**  
I am actively contributing to opensource projects.

🏗️ **C4GT '25 Contributor**  
Built an **Education Management Information System** for **ADC Karnal**.

🌸 **Women Engineers scholar '24 by Google × TalentSprint**

🎓 **LiFT '25 Scholar**

✍️ **I write blogs**  
I enjoy documenting what I learn you can find my blogs linked [here](https://medium.com/@kajaljotwani06).

🏃‍♀️ **Fun fact**  
If you don't find me coding, you'll probably find me running or at the gym.
