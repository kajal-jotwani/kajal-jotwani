    I write code with a cup of coffee, a curious mind,

### 🌿 About Me

✨ Computer Science student  
💻 Full-stack & backend learner  
🌱 Open-source enthusiast  
☕ Runs on coffee, curiosity, and clean code  

I love building things that **feel meaningful**, whether that’s:
- contributing to open-source,
- learning how systems work under the hood,
- or turning small ideas into real products.

I’m someone who enjoys the *process* as much as the outcome — learning, breaking things, fixing them, and growing a little every day.
